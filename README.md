# Advent of Code 2022!

## Goals 
- Use Rust as much as possible, reverting to a more familiar language when needed
- Use a TDD workflow when it makes sense
- Refactor puzzles when time allows

## Usage
`cargo run -- [day number]`\
if a `day number` is not provided, it will run for the current day.\
This will work... at least until the end of December.
